## Usage
 **VALORANT must be open**.

### Bundled Release:

1) Download [Microsoft Visual C++ Libraries](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases)
2) Download the [release](https://github.com/isaacKenyon/valorant-rank-yoinker/releases/latest).
3) Extract **all** files.
4) Run vRY.exe.

### Running from source:

1) Download Python [3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/) or [3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/), make sure it is added to the PATH. (This is an option on installation.)
2) Download the [source](https://github.com/isaacKenyon/VALORANT-rank-yoinker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
3) Run **`INSTALL.bat`** file (or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal)
4) Run **`START.bat`** file (or use `python main.py` in the terminal)

### Compiling from source:

1) `pip install cx_Freeze`
2) `python setup.py build`
3)  Open the new Build folder and find vRY.exe.

> `-` You can change the desired weapon by editing the gun in `config.json`, or by deleting the file for vRY re-prompt you.

> `-` View all skins: <https://vry.netlify.app/matchLoadouts>.

### Letting Github Build It:

The latest commits to the `main` branch will be built by a [Github Actions](https://github.com/isaacKenyon/VALORANT-rank-yoinker/actions) workflow 
and a successful build should result in a compiled artifact that you can download and try out.
See the [Actions tab](https://github.com/isaacKenyon/VALORANT-rank-yoinker/actions), click on the `Build` workflow, 
select a particular workflow run, and it should have an artifact available for download. 

If you want to make a small change to the application, you can:
1) [Fork](https://github.com/isaacKenyon/VALORANT-rank-yoinker/fork) this project.
2) Change the code in your forked repository.
3) Let the Github Actions workflow build vRY.exe for you.
4) Download it and test it.
5) Submit a Pull Request if you would like your change included in future releases.

## What about that Tweet?

 The [Tweet](https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1539728676815642624), which details Riot's API policies, outlines how
 applications are not allowed to expose data hidden by the game client. As of Version 1.262, vRY respects streamer mode.
